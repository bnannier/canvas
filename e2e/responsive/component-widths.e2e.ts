/**
 * Nothing scrolls sideways, and the form-factor switcher really clamps the preview.
 *
 * Responsiveness is a core requirement of every Canvas component rather than an
 * add-on, and horizontal overflow is how a failure of it shows up: a table that will
 * not narrow, a row that refuses to stack, a fixed width with no maxWidth beside it.
 * The docgen guardrail already refuses a bare `width >= 280` in an example, which
 * catches the authored cause; this catches the rendered effect, including the causes
 * that live in the component rather than in the example.
 *
 * Two nodes are checked, because the docs scroll in an INNER view: the document
 * itself, and the page's own scroller (docs/src/ui/page.tsx marks it).
