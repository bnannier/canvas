/**
 * The end-to-end suite: what the docs app actually does in a real browser.
 *
 * This is the DETERMINISTIC half of Canvas's visual verification. It asserts facts
 * (a route painted, nothing threw, nothing overflowed, Escape closed the overlay,
 * these pixels match the baseline). Taste is judged separately by lookout, which
 * reads lookout.config.ts and files opinions; the two are meant not to overlap.
 *
 * What it runs against, in order of preference:
 *
 *   E2E_BASE_URL set  Whatever is already serving, typically `cd docs && bun run dev`
 *                     (Metro on 8081). Convenient while writing a spec; note Metro is
 *                     a DEV build, so React's own development warnings reach the
 *                     console gate.
 *   otherwise         The web export in docs/dist, served by e2e/support/serve-dist.ts
 *                     with the SPA rewrite and the production Content-Security-Policy
 *                     from docs/public/_headers. This is the canonical run: it tests
 *                     the bytes that ship. Build it with `cd docs && bun run build:web`.
 *
 * There are no retries on purpose. A test that only passes sometimes is a defect in
 * the test or the app, and hiding it behind a retry is the shortcut this repo does
 * not take. Every wait in the suite is a wait on observable state, never a sleep.
