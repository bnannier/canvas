// Canvas is a react-native-web kit: every export ultimately touches React
// context, state, or browser APIs, so the whole package is a client boundary.
// Declaring it here means a React Server Components consumer (Next.js App
// Router) can import the kit from a server component without each app having
// to remember its own "use client" wrapper. tsc preserves this prologue into
// dist/index.js, the package's only public JS entry.
