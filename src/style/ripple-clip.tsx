// Clip a BOUNDED Android ripple to a rounded control's corners.
//
// Why this exists (and why a same-node `overflow:"hidden"` does NOT work): a bounded
// `android_ripple` (borderless:false) is installed as the pressable's OWN background
// drawable, masked to a RECTANGLE (React Native's RippleDrawable mask is a full-bounds
// ColorDrawable — see ReactDrawableHelper.getMask). React Native implements
// `overflow:"hidden"` NOT via Android's clipToOutline but as a manual rounded path-clip
// applied only in `ViewGroup.dispatchDraw` — i.e. only to CHILD views. A view's own
// background (the ripple) is drawn in `View.draw()` BEFORE dispatchDraw, so a node can
// never clip its own ripple; the rectangle bleeds past the rounded corners. The only fix
// on this architecture is to make the ripple-bearing pressable a CHILD of a rounded,
// `overflow:"hidden"` parent, so the parent's dispatchDraw path-clip rounds the child's
// ripple. Setting `borderRadius` on that parent installs a rounded CompositeBackgroundDrawable,
// which is what makes the clip path rounded rather than a plain rect.
//
// `<RippleClip>` is that parent. It wraps a pressable and, ON ANDROID ONLY, clips it to
// the supplied `shape` (the same corner radii the pressable draws). On iOS and web there
// is no ripple to clip, so it adds no clip — it is a transparent layout passthrough that
// still owns the outer layout (`style`), keeping the node structure identical across
// platforms. Route every rounded, bounded-ripple control through it; borderless ripples
// (radial, unmasked) need no clip and must not use it.
