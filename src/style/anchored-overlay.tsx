// AnchoredOverlay: a floating card pinned just below a trigger, with
// cross-platform outside-tap dismissal, from RN primitives only.
//
// When an <OverlayProvider> is mounted (an app root, or a docs example stage),
// the card plus a full-bleed dismiss backdrop are portaled into its outlet and
// the card is positioned at the trigger's coordinates measured RELATIVE TO the
// outlet (measureInWindow on both, subtract). So the card escapes the trigger's
// bounds with NO position:"fixed" and NO Platform.OS branch, and a tap anywhere
// off the card dismisses it on every platform.
//
// With no provider it degrades to the kit's pre-portal inline anchor (the
// caller's own absolute top:100% style, passed as `inlineStyle`), so an unhosted
// consumer still renders — just without the over-the-page escape or the backdrop,
// exactly as the kit behaved before the portal layer.
//
// Width is the caller's concern: it already measures its trigger (onLayout) and
// passes the card's width/min-width via `cardStyle`. This helper owns only the
// x/y placement and the backdrop.
