// Desktop-first responsive selection. The `base` value is the desktop case, and a
// breakpoint entry applies at that width AND BELOW, with the smallest matching
// breakpoint winning:
//
//   const direction = useResponsive({ base: "row", sm: "column" });
//   // <View style={{ flexDirection: direction }} />
//
// Only the breakpoints present in the map are considered, mirroring how a
// className like `flex-row sm:flex-col` only flips at the `sm` threshold.
//
// CHOOSING A RESPONSIVENESS MECHANISM (in order of preference):
//
// 1. Intrinsic sizing: can layout alone solve it? A fixed desktop width plus
//    maxWidth:"100%" (fields, dialogs, chart roots), or minWidth floors plus
//    flexWrap (Stats). Zero JS, zero re-renders, correct in any container,
//    correct on frame one and on the server. Do NOT swap a fixed width for
//    width:"100%" below a threshold; see the field-width.ts post-mortem.
//
// 2. Container measurement: does the component need a discrete layout switch?
//    Measure your OWN width (useContainerBreakpoint / useMeasuredWidth in
//    container.ts), never the window. A component cannot know whether it is on
//    a phone or in a 320px desktop panel; only its container width is truthful
//    (the DataTable precedent). Render the base (desktop) variant on the
//    unmeasured first frame; gate on `measured` only when rendering the wrong
//    variant is worse than rendering nothing (chart geometry).
//
// 3. Viewport breakpoints (this file): is this window-level chrome? Only
//    components whose job is to partition the window itself (the Sidebar's
//    drawer mode, navbars, app shells) and window-anchored overlays may read
//    the viewport. If the component could plausibly sit inside a column, it is
//    not window-level chrome.
//
// The hooks here share ONE Dimensions subscription and re-render their
// consumers only when the active breakpoint BUCKET changes, not on every
// resize pixel. A width of 0 (react-native-web before the DOM exists, i.e.
// SSR and the pre-hydration frame) resolves to `base`: the kit is
// desktop-first, so an unknown viewport renders the desktop variant, and the
// server, the hydration render, and the first client frame agree. SSR apps
// that know they are serving a narrow client can pass ThemeProvider's
// `ssrBreakpoint` to shift that assumption (the `ssrScheme` contract).
//
// Height and orientation are deliberately not modeled: no kit component keys
// layout off viewport height today. Reading raw pixels stays available via the
// `useWindowDimensions` re-export.

 * - This simulates the VIEWPORT tier only. Container-measured components

 *   constrain the subtree's width to the matching size alongside the
 *   override, and both mechanisms tell the same story.
