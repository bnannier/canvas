// The one status-tone to palette-hue map the kit's toned surfaces read.
//
// Alert (the info / success / warning / error banner) and Badge (the status pill
// with its leading dot) carry the same four semantic tones, so they must resolve
// to the same Tailwind hue family: if they drift, a "warning" alert and a
// "warning" badge sitting in the same view stop reading as the same state. Each
// component used to keep a private copy of the mapping (Alert's TONE_HUE,
// Badge's STATUS_HUE, identical in every entry); this is that mapping, owned once.
//
// It names the HUE ONLY, never a step. Each component still picks its own steps
// off `palette` (Alert: a 50/200 surface with a 600/700/800 type ramp in light and
// a 950/800 surface with a 200/300/400 ramp in dark; Badge: the same pill surfaces
// with a 700/400 label and a saturated 500 dot), because the step ladder is that
// component's own density and contrast decision, not a shared one.
//
// The neutral tone is deliberately absent: neutral rides the semantic tokens
// (muted / border / muted-foreground), which are scheme-aware already, so it never
// reaches for a palette hue. Components keep neutral as their own union member and
// branch on it before indexing this map.
