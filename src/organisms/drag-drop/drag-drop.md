# Drag & drop

Wrap a surface in a `DragDropProvider`, mark droppable regions with `DropZone`, and make items draggable with `Draggable` plus a `DragHandle` grip. Items lift into a floating ghost and reorder within or across zones, position-aware. It runs on iOS, Android, and the web from one PanResponder + Animated code path, and the grip is keyboard- and screen-reader-operable: press Space to grab, the arrow keys to move, Space to drop, Escape to cancel.

The reading direction is respected throughout. In a right-to-left locale a `horizontal` zone lays its items out right to left, so the first position is the rightmost one, the drop indicator meets the row's right edge, and the two horizontal arrows swap roles (Left Arrow moves forward, Right Arrow back, per the WAI-ARIA practices). Vertical lists and the up/down arrows read the same way in both directions.

## Usage

```tsx
<Stateful initial={[
  { id: "a", zone: "list", title: "Design review" },
  { id: "b", zone: "list", title: "Write the tests" },
  { id: "c", zone: "list", title: "Ship the release" },
]}>
  {(cards, setCards) => (
    <DragDropProvider>
      <DropZone id="list" label="Tasks" onDrop={(e) => setCards(applyDrop(cards, e))} style={{ width: 280, maxWidth: "100%", minHeight: 96 }}>
        <Column snug>
          {cards.map((c) => (
            <Draggable key={c.id} id={c.id} data={c} label={c.title}>
              <Card compact>
                <Row between alignCenter>
                  <Typography small>{c.title}</Typography>
                  <DragHandle label={`Reorder ${c.title}`} />
                </Row>
              </Card>
            </Draggable>
          ))}
        </Column>
      </DropZone>
    </DragDropProvider>
  )}
</Stateful>
```

## Variants

### Between columns

A `DropZone` per column; dragging a card moves it into another column at the drop position. The
shared list is a flat array with a `zone` field, and `applyDrop` re-homes the card.

```tsx
<Stateful initial={[
  { id: "t1", zone: "todo", title: "Rotate secrets" },
  { id: "t2", zone: "todo", title: "Draft the review" },
  { id: "t3", zone: "doing", title: "SSO rollout" },
]}>
  {(cards, setCards) => (
    <Row relaxed alignStart>
      <DragDropProvider>
        <Row relaxed alignStart>
          {["todo", "doing"].map((zone) => (
            <DropZone key={zone} id={zone} label={zone === "todo" ? "To do" : "Doing"} onDrop={(e) => setCards(applyDrop(cards, e))} style={{ width: 200, maxWidth: "100%", minHeight: 120 }}>
              <Column snug>
                <Typography small semibold>{zone === "todo" ? "To do" : "Doing"}</Typography>
                {cards.filter((c) => c.zone === zone).map((c) => (
                  <Draggable key={c.id} id={c.id} data={c} label={c.title}>
                    <Card compact>
                      <Row between alignCenter>
                        <Typography small>{c.title}</Typography>
                        <DragHandle label={`Reorder ${c.title}`} />
                      </Row>
                    </Card>
                  </Draggable>
                ))}
              </Column>
            </DropZone>
          ))}
        </Row>
      </DragDropProvider>
    </Row>
  )}
</Stateful>
```

### Locked item

Pass `disabled` to a `Draggable` to pin it in place: its grip dims and becomes inert while the
rest of the list stays draggable.

```tsx
<DragDropProvider>
  <DropZone id="list" label="Tasks" style={{ width: 280, maxWidth: "100%", minHeight: 96 }}>
    <Column snug>
      <Draggable id="a" data={{ id: "a", zone: "list" }} label="Design review">
        <Card compact>
          <Row between alignCenter>
            <Typography small>Design review</Typography>
            <DragHandle label="Reorder Design review" />
          </Row>
        </Card>
      </Draggable>
      <Draggable id="b" data={{ id: "b", zone: "list" }} disabled label="Locked task">
        <Card compact>
          <Row between alignCenter>
            <Typography small muted>Locked task</Typography>
            <DragHandle label="Locked task" />
          </Row>
        </Card>
      </Draggable>
    </Column>
  </DropZone>
</DragDropProvider>
```

## Do & Don't

### Grip and fallback

**Do** — Give each item a labeled `DragHandle` and keep a non-drag way to move it. The grip is a keyboard tab stop that grabs on Space and moves with the arrows; a `RowMenu` "Move to" beside it is a good extra path for pointer and assistive-tech users.

```tsx
<DragDropProvider>
  <DropZone id="list" label="Tasks" style={{ width: 280, maxWidth: "100%", minHeight: 96 }}>
    <Draggable id="a" data={{ id: "a", zone: "list" }} label="Design review">
      <Card compact>
        <Row between alignCenter>
          <Typography small>Design review</Typography>
          <Row snug alignCenter>
            <DragHandle label="Reorder Design review" />
            <RowMenu items={[{ label: "Move to Doing", icon: "arrowRight" }]} triggerLabel="Move Design review" />
          </Row>
        </Row>
      </Card>
    </Draggable>
  </DropZone>
</DragDropProvider>
```

**Don't** — Don't make a bare card the only drag surface with no grip and no alternative: whole-card dragging fights taps and scrolling, and it leaves keyboard and screen-reader users with no way to move the item at all.

```tsx
<Card compact>
  <Pressable onPress={() => {}}>
    <Typography small>Design review (drag the whole card?)</Typography>
  </Pressable>
</Card>
```
