// Co-located DashboardGrid skins, one per platform. DashboardGrid is a "Shared" treatment:
// the whole component is LAYOUT (a wrapping 12-column row of measured cells) plus one edit-
// mode affordance, and flexbox renders identically on iOS, Android, and react-native-web, so
// iosSkin and androidSkin reference the exact same object as webSkin. The three-skin file
// structure exists to match the kit's platform-skin recipe; the columns are INTENTIONALLY
// identical, and the sharing is the point rather than an oversight (the layout.styles.ts and
// grid.styles.ts precedent).
//
// What per-OS character the board does carry comes from the parts it composes: the widget's
// own content brings its card surface, and the drag grip, ghost, and insertion indicator come
// from the platform's own DragDrop family (passed in by the per-OS entry file). Nothing here
// would gain from an iOS or Material 3 delta.
//
// The cells stay bare: a widget arrives with its own surface (a Card, a Chart, a Stats row),
// so a fill or a border here would double-frame it. The only paint is the customize-mode
// affordance, which exists precisely to say "this cell is now a draggable object".

// the extra row.
