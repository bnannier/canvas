// Shared DashboardGrid shell. A 12-column widget board: each widget declares a span in
// twelfths, the grid measures its OWN width, resolves every span for the tier that width
// falls in, and lays the cells out as a wrapping row. Locked (the default) it is a plain
// static grid; `unlocked` turns it into customize mode, where every cell becomes a drop
// target with a drag grip and the order can be rearranged.
//
// The whole drag interaction (the pointer ghost, the insertion indicator, the keyboard
// grab/move/drop, the screen-reader announcements) comes from the kit's own DragDrop
// family; DashboardGrid adds only the grid structure and the order bookkeeping, which is
// pure and lives in dashboard-grid.logic.ts. Board is the precedent for this composition.
//
// THE DROP MODEL, and why each cell is its own DropZone. drag-drop.geometry.ts resolves an
// insertion index along ONE main axis (`insertionIndexFor` walks card midpoints in Y, or in
// X for a horizontal zone), so a wrapped two-dimensional grid cannot be a single DropZone:
// the second row's cards would be indexed by the same axis as the first row's. Zone
// HIT-TESTING, though, is fully two-dimensional (`withinRect` tests X and Y). So every
// widget cell is its own DropZone (zone id = widget id, zone label = widget title) holding
// exactly ONE Draggable with the same id. A drop therefore always lands on a target widget,
// and the zone's single-card insertion index collapses to a binary: 0 means the pointer
// stopped before the target's midpoint, 1 means past it. That is exactly "place the dragged
// widget before / after this target", which is `moveWidget`'s signature.
//
// Which midpoint decides is per cell: a cell that fills the row (12 columns) is stacked
// above and below its neighbors, so it splits vertically; a narrower cell shares its row,
// so it splits horizontally (`horizontal` on the DropZone picks the axis). The keyboard
// path needs no axis at all: the arrow keys walk the zone list, which is widget order.
//
// CHROME SPLIT. A widget arrives with its own surface (a Card, a Chart, a Stats row), so
// cells render BARE: no fill, no border, no header. `title` is an accessibility name for
// the drop zone and the draggable, not visible chrome. Only customize mode paints, and its
// grips are ALWAYS visible while unlocked rather than hover-revealed: React Native has no
// portable hover event, and an explicit edit mode already announces itself. Locked, the
// drag provider is not mounted at all, so a read-only dashboard carries none of the drag
// machinery's listeners or measurement.
