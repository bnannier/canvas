// preview. M3 12dp thumbnail, M3 type roles, and a surfaceRipple press feedback. The
// composed atoms are the M3-styled ones so each people tile renders the native Card
// (the M3 medium-shape card corner, elevation-1, 16dp padding, surfaceRipple) with an
// M3 Avatar/Badge/Button. The literal `.android` imports are required for the WEB docs 3-up, where
// barrel imports would resolve the web atoms.
