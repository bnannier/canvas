// Per-OS Card skins. Card is a "Light" platform treatment: one structure and one
// set of (semantic) colors live in card.shared.tsx; only the small native touches
// shift per OS on the MAIN card surface, namely the corner radius (+ the iOS
// corner curve), the surface's border-vs-elevation treatment, the card's own
// content density (its padding + the gap between flat children), and the elevation
// / shadow. Press feedback (the interactive / onPress affordance) is handled in
// the shell: Android gets android_ripple, iOS/web get a pressed opacity dim.
//
// The composition subcomponents (CardHeader/CardTitle/CardContent/CardFooter/
// CardSeparator) are STATIC shared members, so their insets and type are shared
// (one value across platforms); only the main surface is skin-parameterized.
//
// - Web keeps the established look: 8px radius, 1px border, shadow-sm resting,
//   the established Catalyst/shadcn card insets and density values; the default
//   density also carries the card's own flat-child gap (padding implies rhythm).
// - iOS follows HIG conventions: iOS has no card control, so the structure is kept
//   and only iOS touches are applied: a larger 12pt radius with Apple's continuous
//   (superellipse) corner curve, and the shared Light-treatment 1px border. Native
//   iOS grouped surfaces are flat, so the resting card drops to no shadow (raised
//   still lifts).
// - Android matches Material 3 cards, where outline and elevation are mutually
//   exclusive: the default card is the M3 ELEVATED card (level-1 elevation, NO
//   visible outline), `flat` is the M3 OUTLINED card (1dp outline, elevation 0),
//   `raised` lifts the elevated card to M3 level 3 (6dp). Plus the M3 medium
//   shape (12dp corner radius) and tighter M3 density steps.
