# Alert

Inline notification banners: info, success, warning, and error, plus a full-width announcement bar. For a blocking confirmation prompt, see Alert Dialog.

## Usage

Pressing the trailing "×" (`dismissible`) hides the banner out of the box; `onDismiss` reports it, and a controlled `dismissed` prop hands that state to the parent instead. Action buttons are real Buttons: wire each one's `onPress`, and the line underneath reports the result. (`Stateful` is a docs-only helper that holds the example's state; in your app that state is your own.)

```tsx
<Stateful initial={0}>
  {(opens, setOpens) => (
    <Column snug>
      <Alert
        info
        icon={<Icon info size={16} />}
        title="Heads up"
        description="Maintenance window scheduled for Sunday 2:00 UTC."
        dismissible
        actions={<Button link small onPress={() => setOpens(opens + 1)}>Learn more</Button>}
      />
      <Typography muted>{opens === 0 ? "Maintenance notes not opened yet" : `Opened the maintenance notes ${opens} ${opens === 1 ? "time" : "times"}`}</Typography>
    </Column>
  )}
</Stateful>
```

## Variants

### Success

```tsx
<Stateful initial={0}>
  {(views, setViews) => (
    <Column snug>
      <Alert
        success
        icon="✓"
        title="All set"
        description="Your changes have been saved successfully."
        dismissible
        actions={<Button ghost small onPress={() => setViews(views + 1)}>View changes</Button>}
      />
      <Typography muted>{views === 0 ? "Changes not viewed yet" : `Viewed ${views} ${views === 1 ? "time" : "times"}`}</Typography>
    </Column>
  )}
</Stateful>
```

### Warning

```tsx
<Stateful initial={0}>
  {(starts, setStarts) => (
    <Column snug>
      <Alert
        warning
        icon={<Icon alertTriangle size={16} />}
        title="Action required"
        description="Your trial expires in 3 days."
        dismissible
        actions={<Button primary small onPress={() => setStarts(starts + 1)}>Upgrade plan</Button>}
      />
      <Typography muted>{starts === 0 ? "Upgrade flow not opened yet" : `Opened the upgrade flow ${starts} ${starts === 1 ? "time" : "times"}`}</Typography>
    </Column>
  )}
</Stateful>
```

### Error

```tsx
<Stateful initial={0}>
  {(retries, setRetries) => (
    <Column snug>
      <Alert
        error
        icon="✕"
        title="Something went wrong"
        description="Could not save your changes. Please try again."
        dismissible
        actions={<Button primary small onPress={() => setRetries(retries + 1)}>Retry</Button>}
      />
      <Typography muted>{retries === 0 ? "Not retried yet" : `Retried ${retries} ${retries === 1 ? "time" : "times"}`}</Typography>
    </Column>
  )}
</Stateful>
```

## Do & Don't

### info

**Do** — Reserve info for passive, non-urgent context (notices, tips); escalate to warning or destructive when action is required.

```tsx
<Alert info icon={<Icon info size={16} />} title="Heads up" description="Maintenance window scheduled for Sunday 2:00 UTC." />
```

**Don't** — Dressing an act-now message in the neutral info tone hides the urgency; users skim past it like an FYI.

```tsx
<Alert info icon={<Icon info size={16} />} title="Trial expires today" description="Upgrade now or you'll lose access to your projects." />
```

### success

**Do** — Make confirmations transient: auto-dismiss or give a Dismiss control so the success state clears once acknowledged.

```tsx
<Alert
  success
  icon="✓"
  title="Saved"
  description="Your changes have been saved successfully."
  dismissible
/>
```

**Don't** — A success banner pinned with no way to dismiss it lingers as visual noise long after the action is done.

```tsx
<Alert success icon="✓" title="Saved" description="Your changes have been saved successfully." />
```

### warning

**Do** — State the consequence, the deadline, and the action: name what's wrong and give a button to resolve it.

```tsx
<Alert
  warning
  icon={<Icon alertTriangle size={16} />}
  title="Action required"
  description="Your trial expires in 3 days. Upgrade to keep your projects."
  actions={<Button primary small>Upgrade plan</Button>}
/>
```

**Don't** — A warning with no specifics or next step leaves the user guessing what to fix and by when.

```tsx
<Alert warning icon={<Icon alertTriangle size={16} />} title="Action required" description="Something needs your attention." />
```

### destructive

**Do** — Match the variant to the severity: reserve destructive for genuine failures, success for confirmations.

```tsx
<Alert error icon="✕" title="Something went wrong" description="Could not save your changes. Please try again." />
```

**Don't** — Using the destructive variant for non-errors cries wolf; users learn to tune out red and miss real failures.

```tsx
<Alert error icon="✕" title="Saved" description="Your changes have been saved successfully." />
```
