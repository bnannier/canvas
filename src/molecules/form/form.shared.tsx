// Shared Form shell. Form is a COMPOSITION surface: the caller stitches the field
// atoms (Input, Select, Checkbox, a FormSection, any node) as children and keeps
// ownership of their state through each atom's own controlled/uncontrolled props.
// Form contributes only what the group needs as a whole:
//   - the vertical rhythm between rows (and the optional two-column flow that
//     collapses to one column on phones, desktop-first),
//   - the actions row: a primary submit + an outline cancel composed from the kit
//     Button, rendered when a label is given,
//   - form semantics for assistive tech, and Enter-to-submit on the web.
// It deliberately owns NO field state and collects no values: `onSubmit` is a
// plain callback, and the caller reads its own state (this keeps every atom
// decoupled from Form and its API identical inside or outside one).
//
// Form is a "Light" platform treatment. Neither iOS nor Android ships a native
// form control (PLATFORM-REFERENCES.md): SwiftUI Form renders as a grouped inset
// list, and Material 3 composes forms from text fields, selection controls, and
// buttons. So the per-OS touches are conventions only (SF type/rhythm on iOS, M3
// type tracking on Android), and the WEB look is kept verbatim.

// The submit/cancel Button the Form composes, typed as the atom component so the
// public atom API is preserved across every build path. Each platform's thin
// wrapper passes its platform-correct Button (the iOS wrapper passes `.ios`,
// etc.) so the WEB docs 3-up preview shows the right control per row; on a real
// device Metro resolves the right extension regardless.
