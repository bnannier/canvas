// Shared Field shell. A form row: a label, the control, and one message line under it.
//
// Field exists for the part no control owns on its own — the message. Every field family already
// owns its label (that is the "components own their label anatomy" rule, and it is what lets
// Android float the label inside the box), but nothing in the kit renders the helper or the error
// text, so callers were hand-stacking a Text under an Input and drifting on type and color.
//
// The load-bearing behavior is LABEL DELEGATION. When the single child is a control that owns its
// own label anatomy, Field hands the label DOWN rather than drawing one beside it, so each platform
// still places it per its own contract: a static title above on web and iOS, the Material 3
// in-container floating label on Android. A label rendered next to such a control could never
// float, which is exactly the Android divergence this avoids. Any other child (a Switch, a group)
// keeps the static label above, because those do not own a label slot of that kind.
