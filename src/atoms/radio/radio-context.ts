// Shared context that lets a RadioGroup own the single-select state and a child
// Radio read it. A radio, unlike a checkbox, cannot be the source of its own
// on/off state (radios don't un-check themselves); the GROUP holds "which one is
// chosen". This context carries the chosen value down and the select action back
// up, so a `<Radio value="…">` inside a `<RadioGroup>` reflects and moves the
// selection without the caller wiring any state. A Radio with no surrounding
// group falls back to its own controlled `checked`/`selected` props.
