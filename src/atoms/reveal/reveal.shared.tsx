// Shared Reveal shell. The structure (one Animated.View wrapping the content), the
// boolean-prop axes, the ordinal-to-delay conversion, and the Reduce Motion policy all
// live here once; a platform file supplies only its skin (the travel distances,
// durations, trigger insets, and stagger step) and calls createReveal.
//
// WHAT IT IS. A content entrance triggered by scroll position: the wrapped content
// starts slightly offset on ONE axis and transparent, and when the element reaches the
// viewport it moves to its resting place and fades in, once. Only transform and
// opacity animate, never layout, so the entrance is safe under Android's New
// Architecture and cannot reflow the page it is arriving into. The content itself is
// always mounted and always present to assistive technology: Reveal animates it, it
// never withholds it, so a screen reader user is never waiting on a scroll position
// for content to exist.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT src/style/entrance.tsx, and why merging them would be a regression.
// A future maintainer will notice that both fade something in and want one component.
// They are different animations with different dependencies:
//   - Entrance is a corner-pinned spring MORPH for overlays. It scales about a pinned
//     corner so a menu appears to grow out of the control that opened it, which
//     requires it to MEASURE ITS OWN SIZE before it can start (the pin is a function
//     of width and height), and it is spring-driven for the elastic Liquid Glass feel.
//     Its trigger is mount: an overlay that exists is an overlay that is opening.
//   - Reveal is a timed ONE-AXIS translation for page content. It needs no size at
//     all, it is timing-driven with an explicit duration and delay because a staggered
//     set must have a predictable rhythm (springs do not stagger cleanly), and its
//     trigger is a SCROLL POSITION, which means an ongoing measurement against the
//     window for as long as it stays pending.
// Merging them would force one component to carry both a measure-before-start
// dependency and a scroll dependency, and to be both spring and timing. The overlays
// (menu, popover, dialog, alert dialog) would then be paying for scroll observation to
// perform an animation that has nothing to do with scrolling, and their corner pin,
// which is exact only because the spring's overshoot stays linear in progress, would
// have to survive a refactor it cannot express. Leave them separate.
//
// RTL: the horizontal props are PHYSICAL (fromLeft / fromRight), not logical
// (fromStart / fromEnd), and they do not mirror under a right-to-left layout. This is
// a deliberate exception to how the kit treats direction, and the kit has a scar that
// makes the exception worth stating: src/style/rtl.ts exists only because
// react-native-web's I18nManager exposes no `isRTL` property, so a direct read of it
// is `undefined` on web, and the Drawer consequently slid in from the wrong side. The
// difference is what the direction MEANS. A Drawer's side is functional: it says which
// edge of the screen the panel belongs to, so in a right-to-left layout it must move
// with the layout or the panel covers the wrong content. A Reveal's direction is
// decorative: a short travel of a few dp that has already finished by the time the
// reader engages with the content, carrying no information about reading order or
// screen anatomy. Mirroring it would silently invert a designer's choice for no
// functional gain, and the physical name is then also honest about what happens. If a
// call site ever needs a travel that genuinely tracks reading direction, that is a new
// logical axis (fromStart / fromEnd) routed through isRTL(), added alongside these,
// not a change of meaning underneath them.
