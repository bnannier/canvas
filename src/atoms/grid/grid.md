# Grid

The container-measured auto-fit tile grid. `minTileWidth` sets the floor
(default 240): the grid fits as many equal-width columns of at least that width
as its own measured container allows, and re-fits as the container changes, so
the same grid renders three-up on a desktop, two-up on a tablet, and a single
column on a phone with no breakpoint at the call site. `columns` caps the count
at the desktop number, the gap scale is Row and Column's own
(`flush` / `tight` / `snug` / `cozy` / `relaxed` / `loose`), and a `GridItem`
child with `wide` spans two cells. Equal-width tiles belong here; content-sized
rows that should stack at narrow widths belong to `Row stacks`.

## Usage

```tsx
<Grid minTileWidth={220}>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography medium>Overview</Typography>
    <Typography small muted>Traffic is up 12% this week.</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography medium>Deploys</Typography>
    <Typography small muted>14 releases shipped to production.</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography medium>Alerts</Typography>
    <Typography small muted>2 open, both acknowledged.</Typography>
  </Card>
</Grid>
```

```

### Wide tile

```tsx

### Tight gap

```tsx
<Grid minTileWidth={160} tight>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography small>CPU</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography small>Memory</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography small>Disk</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography small>Network</Typography>

```

## Do & Don't

### Column math

**Do** — Give the grid a tile floor (and optionally a desktop cap) and let it
fit its container.

```tsx
<Grid minTileWidth={220} columns={3}>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography medium>Overview</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography medium>Deploys</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded>
    <Typography medium>Alerts</Typography>
  </Card>
</Grid>
```

**Don't** — Hand-roll percent tile widths on a wrapping Row; the column count
is then frozen at the call site and every consumer re-derives the phone
collapse by hand.

```tsx
<Row wrap snug>
  <Card padded style={{ width: "31%" }}>
    <Typography medium>Overview</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded style={{ width: "31%" }}>
    <Typography medium>Deploys</Typography>
  </Card>
  <Card padded style={{ width: "31%" }}>
    <Typography medium>Alerts</Typography>
  </Card>
</Row>
```
