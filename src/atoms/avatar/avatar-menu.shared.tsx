// Shared AvatarMenu shell. AvatarMenu is the account IDENTITY PILL: one capsule
// trigger holding the avatar, the person's name over their email, and a trailing
// chevron that rotates while the menu is open, wired to the kit's own Dropdown for
// the menu itself. It exists so no app (or docs topbar) hand-composes an account
// menu out of an Avatar, a hand-rolled name column, and a chevron: the anatomy,
// the per-OS pill metrics, the open fill, and the accessible name live here once.
//
// The capsule is passed to Dropdown as its CUSTOM TRIGGER, so Dropdown's own
// Pressable owns the press, the open/close toggle, the outside-tap dismissal, and
// the button role. There is deliberately no second Pressable inside the capsule
// (that would nest one interactive element in another; see
// test/no-console-violations.test.tsx). AvatarMenu owns the open state so the pill
// can paint its open fill and rotate the chevron, and passes open/onOpenChange
// down to keep Dropdown in step.
//
// The pill's disc is the Avatar `tiny` step (24px), the size the hand-off draws
// inside the capsule on every platform, so the inset around it stays 4 on web, 6
// on iOS, and 8 on Android instead of collapsing to a ring around the photo.
//
// AvatarMenu is a "Light" platform treatment on the same AvatarSkin family as
// Avatar and AvatarGroup: one structure and one behavior, with the capsule's
// height, padding, fill, border, and label type supplied per OS by the skin
// (a 32px `secondary` capsule on web, a 36pt hairline-outlined capsule on iOS, a
// 40dp tonal Material 3 pill on Android). The menu surface is the platform's own
// Dropdown skin, so the popover matches the OS with no work here.
