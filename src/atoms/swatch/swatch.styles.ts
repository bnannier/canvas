// Co-located Swatch skins. Swatch is a "Light" treatment, exactly like Emblem: the
// block sizes, the label lockup, and every color (in the shell) are platform-neutral;
// only the corner radius, the iOS corner curve, and the label type shift per OS
// (Material rounds containers more than iOS/web; iOS draws its tiles with the
// continuous superellipse curve; Material label type carries positive tracking while
// iOS tracks its labels slightly tighter).
//
// The skins carry SHAPE and TYPE metrics only. No skin holds a color: the fill is the
// caller's `color`, and the hairline plus the three label colors come from the active
// theme tokens in the shell, so a Swatch follows light/dark without a per-OS palette.
