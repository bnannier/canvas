# Tooltip

Small floating helper text on hover or focus.

The trigger is a boolean axis of its own, resolved first match wins:

- `children`, an element you already have (an icon `Button`, a `Chip`, any
  control that owns its own press and accessible name). The child renders as-is
  and the tip hangs off it through a wrapper that only LISTENS: no accessibility
  role, no tab stop, and no press of its own, so the child stays the single
  interactive, labelled element, keeps its `onPress`, and the tip never toggles
  on tap. Hover and focus on the child both raise it; the hover region is the
  whole tooltip, so moving onto the bubble keeps it up.
- `iconTrigger`, a ghost icon button carrying a settings glyph.
- `textTrigger`, the `trigger` string as a pressable inline word.
- Otherwise the default: the `trigger` string as an outline Button.

Hover and focus are pointer-and-keyboard affordances. Touch pointers are
skipped, and iOS and Android never fire hover at all, so on native and on touch
the controlled `open` prop is the way to show a tip: drive it from whatever the
platform does offer (a long press, a selected row, an inline help toggle). The
built-in triggers additionally toggle on tap; an element trigger deliberately
does not, because that press belongs to the child.

## Usage

```tsx
<Tooltip label="Open settings" iconTrigger trigger="Hover me" open top />
```

## Variants

### Right

```tsx
<Tooltip label="Open settings" iconTrigger trigger="Hover me" open right />
```

### Bottom

```tsx
<Tooltip label="Open settings" iconTrigger trigger="Hover me" open bottom />
```

### Left

```tsx
<Tooltip label="Open settings" iconTrigger trigger="Hover me" open left />
```

### Button

```tsx
<Tooltip label="Open settings" trigger="Hover me" open top />
```

### Text

```tsx
<Tooltip textTrigger label="Open settings" trigger="hover this text" open top />
```

### Element trigger

```tsx
<Tooltip label="Glass on" open top>
  <Button ghost icon accessibilityLabel="Glass on" iconLeft={<Icon settings size={16} />} onPress={() => {}} />
</Tooltip>
```

### On hover

```tsx
<Tooltip label="Open settings" iconTrigger trigger="Hover me" top />
```

## Do & Don't

**Do** — Keep tooltips short and supplementary; put essential steps in visible copy.

```tsx
<Tooltip iconTrigger bottom open label="Rotate key" />
```

**Don't** — Long, essential instructions hidden in a tooltip are missed on touch and by screen readers.

```tsx
<Tooltip iconTrigger bottom open label="To rotate this key you must first revoke the old one in Settings, then confirm via email within 24 hours." />
```

### top

**Do** — Leave headroom above (or flip to bottom) so a top-placed tooltip stays fully on screen.

```tsx
<Tooltip trigger="Save" top open label="Saves your changes" />
```

**Don't** — A top tooltip on a trigger near the top edge clips above the viewport and goes unread.

```tsx
<View style={{ overflow: "hidden", alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
  <View style={{ marginTop: -16 }}>
    <Tooltip trigger="Save" top open label="Saves your changes" />
  </View>
</View>
```

### right

**Do** — Keep room to the right, or flip the tooltip to the left when the trigger hugs the edge.

```tsx
<Tooltip iconTrigger right open label="More info" />
```

**Don't** — A right tooltip on a control flush against the right edge is cut off by the container.

```tsx
<View style={{ alignItems: "flex-end" }}>
  <Tooltip iconTrigger right open label="More info" />
</View>
```

### bottom

**Do** — Give a bottom tooltip clearance so it never overlaps the interactive content below.

```tsx
<Tooltip trigger="Filters" bottom open label="Refine results" />
```

**Don't** — A bottom tooltip sits right on top of the next row, masking the control beneath it.

```tsx
<View style={{ alignItems: "flex-start", gap: 0 }}>
  <Tooltip trigger="Filters" bottom open label="Refine results" />
  <Button outline small style={{ marginTop: -12 }}>Clear all</Button>
</View>
```

### left

**Do** — Reserve space on the left, or flip to the right, so a left-placed tooltip is never cut off.

```tsx
<Tooltip iconTrigger left open label="Need help?" />
```

**Don't** — A left tooltip on a trigger at the left edge is clipped by the container's left boundary.

```tsx
<View style={{ overflow: "hidden", alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
  <View style={{ marginLeft: -44 }}>
    <Tooltip iconTrigger left open label="Need help?" />
  </View>
</View>
```
