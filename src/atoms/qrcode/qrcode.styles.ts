// field) whatever the app's light/dark theme — the same reason Apple and Google always
// present QR codes on white. So the card shape and the module/field colors are fixed and
// identical on iOS, Android, and the web; the three skin exports point at the same values.

// native per-OS variant, and contrast requirements forbid restyling it per platform).
