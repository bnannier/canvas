// Shared InputOTP shell. The whole structure, state, and accessibility live here
// ONCE; a platform file supplies only its skin (the cell shape/fill/border, the
// active-cell highlight, the digit type scale, the gap and group treatment) and
// calls createInputOTP.
//
// Architecture (the crux): the field is driven by ONE real <TextInput> so native
// SMS autofill, the one-time-code keyboard suggestion, and paste all flow into a
// single value. That input is positioned ABSOLUTELY to fill the whole row and is
// made visually invisible (opacity 0, caret hidden), so tapping anywhere
// on the segmented row focuses it and autofill/paste land in it. The visible
// segment cells (a View + a Text per character) are laid out underneath and read
// from the resolved `value`; the "active" cell (index === value.length, clamped
// to the last cell) shows a caret/ring while the input is focused. Focus is tracked
// in local state for the active-cell highlight ONLY; the value flows through
// useControllableState, so InputOTP works controlled OR uncontrolled (a bare one is typeable).
//
// Because that one input spans the whole row, a tap drops the native caret wherever
// the pointer landed, which on a partly-entered code is the MIDDLE of the string. The
// selection is therefore pinned to the end of the value (see pinCaret below), so a
// keystroke always lands in the first unfilled cell no matter which cell was tapped.
