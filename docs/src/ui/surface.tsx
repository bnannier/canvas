// A docs CONTENT surface: the preview stages, prop tables, do/don't cards and the
// long-form panels. It is solid in every surface mode, because content is the layer
// the kit's glass model deliberately leaves alone: "don't use Liquid Glass in the
// content layer", which is also why the `card` token stays opaque while glass is on.
//
// It used to render through the kit's GlassSurface with `sheer`, so in glass mode it
// stripped its own fill and painted a thin frost. That turned every page's example
// stage into a hole: the backdrop's aurora read straight through the panes, and
// anything sitting ON a stage inherited the problem, so a tinted Emblem tile (a 12
// percent wash of its tone, which is meant to composite against an opaque card) came
// out looking like glass, and an Icon's pane showed the wash behind the glyph.
//
// Glass in these docs belongs to the SHELL only: the topbar, the sidebar and the
// mobile nav bar, which are the kit's own Navbar/Sidebar and take the material
// themselves. Nothing here should compete with them.
//
// `fill` picks the token: `card` for a content panel/stage/table, `muted` for a
// code/chip surface. `bordered` adds the standard rounded hairline frame. Pass extra
// border/radius/overflow through `style`.
