// Bundled sample avatar photos. The docs examples name them as root-absolute paths
// (`/rachel-chen.jpg`), which only resolve when something serves that exact URL:
//   - native: a device has no web origin at all, so the path never resolves and the
//     avatar falls back to initials;
//   - web at a subpath: the browser resolves `/rachel-chen.jpg` against the ORIGIN
//     ROOT, so a static export hosted under /canvas/ (GitHub Pages) 404s. Setting
//     `experiments.baseUrl` does NOT save it: baseUrl rewrites bundler-managed asset
//     and route links, never a string passed as a prop.
// Metro bundles these `require()`d images on every platform and emits URLs that DO
// carry the baseUrl prefix, so mapping the sample paths to the bundled modules makes
// the example photos load on iOS, Android, and the web (at the root and under a
// subpath). Applied in BOTH scopes: see build-scopes.{native,web}.ts.
// The value type is deliberately `unknown`: what Metro hands back from `require()` is
// platform-dependent (an opaque numeric id on native, an asset object on web).

//   - Avatar takes `string | number` and does `source={typeof photo === "number" ? photo
//     : {uri: photo}}` — the web asset OBJECT would become `{uri: {…}}`, rendering no
//     image while the truthy `src` suppresses the initials, leaving a blank circle;
//   - GridList/Feed type their photo as `string` and GridList sniffs it
//     (`value.startsWith("http") || "/" || "data:"`) to tell a photo from initials — a
//     numeric module id there throws `undefined is not a function`.
// Both a Metro dev URL (`http://…`) and an exported asset path (`/canvas/assets/…`)
// satisfy that sniff, and the exported path carries the `experiments.baseUrl` prefix,
// which is what makes a subpath-hosted export work.
