                Branded to the docs' fictional demo company, NOT to Canvas itself.
                Naming the host app here is what got the first App Store submission
                rejected: on a phone the page heading scrolls away, leaving a reviewer
                looking at "Sign in to Canvas" above an email/password form inside an
                app called Canvas. That is indistinguishable from a real login wall,
                and the listing declares that no sign-in is required. Keep every auth
                mockup pointed at Acme Corp so it can never read as this app's own gate.
