// One column's scope: the web skin (`...Canvas`) with the per-OS skins layered over it,
// then the image-bearing components wrapped so the examples' sample photo paths resolve
// to their bundled modules.
//
// The wrapping matters for more than native. The examples name the sample photos as
// root-absolute paths (`/rachel-chen.jpg`), which the browser resolves against the
// ORIGIN ROOT — correct only when the docs are served from `/`. A static export hosted
// under a subpath (GitHub Pages serves this project at /canvas/) would request
// `/rachel-chen.jpg` and 404, because `experiments.baseUrl` only rewrites
// bundler-managed asset and route links, never a string passed as a prop. Routing the
// paths through the bundled `require()`d modules gives them Metro-emitted URLs, which
// DO carry the baseUrl prefix, so the photos load at the root and under a subpath.
//
// Wrap AFTER the skin spread so each column wraps its own effective component
// (PLATFORM_SKINS overrides Avatar, MediaObject, GridList and Feed per OS).
