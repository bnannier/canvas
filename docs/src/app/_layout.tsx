// The whole app renders inside Canvas's ThemeProvider (via DocsThemeProvider) and a
// single adaptive Navbar: the sidebar/topbar shell on web, a native tab bar on iOS and
// Android. Everything below the providers is platform-agnostic screen content. The
// root OverlayProvider is the app-level overlay host: it is flex-sized (outside any
// scroller), so on Android it carries the window blur target for Modal frosts, and
// the ToastProvider's stack portals into its outlet, above every page. Page-level
// hosts still exist inside each scroller so anchored menus scroll with their triggers.
// The tree waits for the fonts on purpose, and it is worth knowing why before removing it.
// Rendering immediately and letting `display: swap` paint fallback text first looks like the
// obvious win, and it was measured: three Lighthouse runs per arm, same build, same server.
// First Contentful Paint did not reliably improve, but Cumulative Layout Shift went from
// 0.006 to 0.16 every time, because Geist's metrics differ enough from the fallback that
// reflowing the whole page on arrival blows straight past the 0.1 "good" threshold. The
// score went DOWN, 75 to 70. Removing this gate is only safe alongside a metric-matched
// fallback face (size-adjust / ascent-override), which React Native Web cannot express
// today because it emits a bare `font-family` with no fallback chain.
