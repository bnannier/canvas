      "The floor is set by exactly two CSS features the token layer uses: oklch() colors and color-mix(). Both have been Baseline across Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox since May 2023, and the versions above are where each engine shipped them. Nothing else in canvas.css is modern: it is plain custom properties, one @media (prefers-reduced-motion) block, and a handful of rules. There is no build step, no @property, and no cascade layers, which is what used to push the Firefox floor to 128.",

If you must support older browsers, restate the same custom properties in a colour space your target supports; the token layer is plain CSS you can copy.",

The token layer's one contribution is the @media (prefers-reduced-motion) block that zeroes the --duration-* variables, so custom CSS written against the motion tokens quiets down with the same preference.",
