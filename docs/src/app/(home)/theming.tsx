        <Section title="Glass Surface">
          <P>
            Following Apple's Liquid Glass model, glass is the material for the functional layer, and for the floating shells and
            overlays inside it: popovers, dialogs, action sheets, the command palette, navbars, tab bars and the sidebar read as
            glass, while content surfaces (cards, lists, tables) stay solid ("don't use glass in the content layer"). The option-list
            menus opt out too: a dropdown, select, autocomplete or avatar menu stays an opaque card, and so do alert dialogs, toasts
            and chart tooltips, because a surface whose rows you read and act on has to stay legible over whatever it opens over. It
            is a theming-level switch (the ThemeProvider turns on the material's own glass-tint fill and rewrites no semantic
            token), not a per-component prop. The glass surfaces render through Canvas's GlassSurface primitive, which paints the real material per
            platform: Apple's native Liquid Glass on iOS 26+ (via expo-glass-effect), a real lens on Chromium browsers (an SVG
            displacement filter that refracts the backdrop at the rim, where the glass bends most; the centre stays optically flat), a
            genuine frosted blur on non-Chromium web and Android (via expo-blur), and a translucent fallback when no material is
            available. It defaults to the platform:{" "}
            glass on iOS 26+ (matching the OS) and solid everywhere else, when you pass neither boolean. Force it with <InlineCode>glass</InlineCode> /{" "}
            <InlineCode>solid</InlineCode> on <InlineCode>ThemeProvider</InlineCode>; that holds on the web too, where components read
            the surface from the provider, not from CSS.

            <Bullet>No semantic token changes: popover and card keep the same opaque values they carry in solid mode. Glass adds its own fill, glass-tint, painted under the material by the surfaces that take it</Bullet>
            <Bullet>The option-list menus (dropdown, select, autocomplete, avatar menu), alert dialogs, toasts and chart tooltips stay opaque in glass mode. A menu is a card of rows the reader picks from, and the Chromium lens keeps the centre of a pane optically flat by design, so a translucent menu shows the page straight through between its rows</Bullet>
