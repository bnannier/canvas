// Writes the MIT LICENSE into the package immediately before it is packed for npm.
//
// Canvas is deliberately split: the SOURCE in this repository is not licensed (all rights
// reserved), while the PUBLISHED PACKAGE — the compiled dist that consumers install — is
// MIT. As the copyright holder you can grant different terms to different recipients, and
// this is the mechanism.
//
// It has to be generated rather than committed, because a LICENSE file at the repository
// root is exactly how GitHub decides a repository's licence: committing MIT there would
// publish the source under MIT too, which is the opposite of the intent. Generating it at
// pack time means the tarball carries the grant and the repository does not.
//
// npm always includes a root LICENSE in the tarball regardless of the `files` array, so
// writing it here is enough; it is gitignored so it never lands in a commit.
//
// Run automatically by `prepublishOnly`. Safe to run by hand: it only writes one file.
