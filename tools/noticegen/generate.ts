/*
 * Third-party licence notice generator.
 *
 * Writes docs/src/data/third-party-notices.ts (pure data, no renderer attached), which
 * `app/(home)/licenses.tsx` renders with Canvas components.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Two of the licences in the shipped dependency set carry an obligation
 * that a `license:` field in package.json does not discharge:
 *
 *   - MIT requires "the above copyright notice and this permission notice" to be included
 *     in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
 *   - OFL-1.1 (the Geist and Geist Mono typefaces) is stricter still: condition 2 says the
 *     font may be bundled and redistributed "provided that each copy contains the above
 *     copyright notice and this license".
 *
 * The app bundles the .ttf files, so the licence has to travel with the artifact. Before
 * this generator existed, no licence text reached the build at all on any platform.
 *
 * HOW THE SET IS CHOSEN. It is not chosen here. tools/noticegen/scan.ts works out which
 * packages actually ship and records them in shipped.json; this generator only turns that
 * list into licence data. See scan.ts for why walking the dependency closure gives the
 * wrong answer (it reports 531 packages and attributes copyleft code the app never
 * contains).
 *
 * HOW TEXTS ARE DEDUPED. Sixty-odd MIT licences are byte-identical apart from their
 * copyright line, so storing each in full would bloat the bundle for no legal benefit.
 * Each licence file is split into the copyright lines (kept PER PACKAGE, because that is
 * the part the notice clause is actually about) and the remaining body (shared). The
 * screen shows both, so the full notice is reconstructible for every package.
 *
 * Run: bun run notices:scan       (rare, slow: recompute which packages ship)
 *      bun run notices:gen        (writes the module)
 *      bun run notices:gen:check  (CI: fails if the checked-in module is stale)
