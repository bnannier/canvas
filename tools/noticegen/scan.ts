/*
 * Determines WHICH packages the Canvas docs app actually ships, and writes the answer to
 * tools/noticegen/shipped.json for tools/noticegen/generate.ts to turn into licence data.
 *
 * This is a separate, slow step on purpose. It runs a real Metro export, so it takes a
 * few minutes; `notices:gen` and its --check counterpart read the committed JSON and
 * stay fast enough for CI.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST WALK package.json. The obvious approach, a breadth-first walk of the
 * runtime dependency closure, is wrong here, and quietly so. `expo` declares its own CLI
 * as a regular dependency, so the closure drags in the entire build toolchain: it reports
 * 531 packages including lightningcss (MPL-2.0), node-forge (BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0),
 * argparse, caniuse-lite and mdn-data. None of those reach the app. Publishing that list
 * would attribute copyleft code the app does not contain, which is worse than useless on
 * a page whose whole job is to be accurate.
 *
 * FOUR SIGNALS, UNIONED:
 *
 *   1. JAVASCRIPT. Export ALL THREE platform bundles (web, iOS, Android) with source maps
 *      and read each map's `sources` array. Every entry under node_modules names a package
 *      that survived tree-shaking and is really in that bundle. The three differ: the web
 *      bundle resolves react-native-web where the native bundles carry react-native's own
 *      JS plus its helpers (@react-native/virtualized-lists, whatwg-fetch, promise, the
 *      css-select family from react-native-svg), so reading only the web map missed 26
 *      packages that ship in the .ipa/.aab.
 *
 *      The maps are written to a temp directory and thrown away. They must never land in
 *      docs/dist: the shipped source maps previously exposed 363 of the kit's own source
 *      files on the public site, which is why `build:web` no longer emits them.
 *
 *   2. EXPO NATIVE MODULES. A package with native code is linked into the .ipa/.aab
 *      whether or not its JavaScript survives, so tree-shaking says nothing about it.
 *      Expo autolinks any dependency carrying an expo-module.config.json, so that file is
 *      the signal.
 *
 *   3. CLASSIC NATIVE MODULES. Packages with native code but NO expo-module.config.json
 *      (a .podspec / android Gradle project: react-native-gesture-handler,
 *      react-native-reanimated, react-native-worklets) are linked by the react-native
 *      side of autolinking, which signal 2 cannot see; when their JavaScript is never
 *      imported, signal 1 cannot see them either, yet their native code ships. Rather
 *      than re-deriving the linking rules from the filesystem, ask the machinery the
 *      native build itself uses: `expo-modules-autolinking react-native-config`.
 *      react-native is the platform rather than anyone's dependency, so the config names
 *      it separately via `reactNativePath`.
 *
 *   4. BAKED DATA. tools/icongen transcribes lucide-static's icon geometry into
 *      src/atoms/icon/icon.glyphs.ts (shipped inside @nannier-com/canvas and drawn by every
 *      <Icon>), and tools/rastergen re-bakes those glyphs into the docs' menu-glyph PNGs.
 *      No lucide JavaScript survives into any bundle, but the shipped data is a copy of
 *      lucide's icons, and its ISC licence requires the copyright and permission notice
 *      to appear in all copies. Attribute the exact package the data is transcribed from.
 *
 * Run: bun run notices:scan   (then `bun run notices:gen`, then commit both outputs)
